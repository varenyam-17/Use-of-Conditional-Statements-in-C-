Aim: To study and implement C++ decision making statements

Theory:Decision-making statements allow a program to take different actions based on different conditions. They’re essential for adding logic and control to the program flow. In C++, the 

main decision-making statements are:

🔹 if Statement


- Executes a block of code only if a specified condition is true.

if (x > 0) {

    cout << "Positive number";
}


🔹 if-else Statement

- Executes one block if the condition is true, and another if false.

if (x > 0) {

    cout << "Positive";
} else    cout << "Non-positive";
}
🔹 else if Ladder
- Checks multiple conditions in sequence.
if (x > 0) {
    cout << "Positive";
} else if (x < 0) {
    cout << "Negative";
} else {
    cout << "Zero";
}

🔹 switch Statement

- Used for checking a variable against multiple constant values. Best for menu-driven programs.

switch (choice) {
case 1: cout << "Option 1"; break;
    case 2: cout << "Option 2"; break;
    default: cout << "Invalid";
}

🔹 Conditional/Ternary Operator ? :

- Shorthand for simple if-else operations.

string result = (x > 0) ? "Positive" : "Non-positive";

These constructs form the backbone of decision-making in programming and are key to implementing control structures in practical applications.

  ALGORITHMS:

 1. Even or Odd~>
 
  - Start

- Input a number n

- Check condition:

- If n % 2 == 0, then

Display “Even number”

- Else

→ Display “Odd number”

- End

2.Vowel or Consonant~>

  - Start

- Input a character ch

- Convert ch to lowercase (if needed)

- Check condition:

- If ch is 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', or 'u' →

Display “Vowel”

- Else if ch is an alphabet character →

→ Display “Consonant”

- Else →

→ Display “Not an alphabet character”

- End

3.To find the Greatest Number among Three Numbers~>

  - Start

- Input three numbers: a, b, and c

- Check conditions:

- If a ≥ b and a ≥ c →
→
Display “a is the greatest”

- Else if b ≥ a and b ≥ c →

→ Display “b is the greatest”

- Else →

→ Display “c is the greatest”

- End

 Conclusion
Understanding and implementing decision-making statements in C++ is fundamental for writing logical and interactive programs. By mastering structures like if, else if, and switch, 
programmers can guide program execution based on dynamic input and real-world conditions. This leads to more efficient, user-friendly, and adaptable software solutions. Practical 
application of these statements enhances problem-solving skills and deepens your grasp of algorithmic thinking.
